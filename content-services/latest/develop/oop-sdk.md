title: Alfresco SDK for out-of-process extensions
---

Alfresco SDK 5.0 is a Maven based development kit that provides an easy to use approach to developing applications and 
out-of-process extensions for Alfresco. With this SDK you can develop, package, test, run, document and release your Alfresco extension project.

The Alfresco Software Development Kit (Alfresco SDK) is a fundamental tool provided by Alfresco to developers to build 
customizations and extensions for the Alfresco Digital Business Platform. It is based on [Apache Maven](http://maven.apache.org/){:target="_blank"} 
and [Docker](https://www.docker.com/){:target="_blank"} and is compatible with major IDEs. This enables Rapid Application Development (RAD) 
and Test Driven Development (TDD).

Alfresco SDK 5.0 is released under [Apache License version 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html){:target="_blank"} 
and supports Content Services both in Community Edition and Enterprise Edition. If you're an Enterprise customer, 
please check the [Alfresco SDK Support status]({% link content-services/latest/support/index.md %}) 
for the version you're using. If your version is in Limited or Full Support and you need help, contact our [Support team](https://support.alfresco.com/){:target="_blank"}.

Alfresco SDK 5.0 is a major update to the SDK and provides support for Alfresco 7.x.

The 5.0 release takes advantage of Semantic Versioning ([SEMVER](http://semver.org/){:target="_blank"}), which means that 
this new release is not directly compatible with the previous releases of the SDK.

If you have existing projects that you wish to upgrade to SDK 5.0, the recommended approach is to generate a new project 
from our archetypes and move your code into place. This might not always be possible as developing out-of-process 
extensions is different from in-process extension development.

## What's new?

Alfresco SDK 5.0 brings changes oriented to assist the way out-of-process customizations are built, packaged, run and 
tested for Content Services 7.

This is a mayor release oriented to support Alfresco 7, so it is not compatible with previous versions of the SDK.
